\section{Application outline}

\subsection{High-Level Architectural Overview}
The program is designed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using three different strategies: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Least-Cost (Uniform Cost) Search (UCS), and A* Search. Each strategy aims to find the route of minimum cost that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city while minimizing the longest distance between two consecutive cities.

\subsection{Input Data Format Specification}
The input data format consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The input data consists of a list of cities. Each city is represented by a pair of coordinates (x, y), and the distance between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Output Data Format Specification}
The output data format includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The output data is the route of minimum cost that satisfies the TSP criteria. 
    \item Additionally the executiion time of the route is provided.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modules in the Application}

\subsubsection{Breadth-First Search (BFS) Module}
\textbf{Function:} \texttt{TSP\_BFS(dist:List[List[int]])}

\textbf{Description:} This function implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the minimum cost route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city, minimizing the longest distance between two consecutive cities.

\textbf{Algorithm Explanation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The BFS algorithm explores all possible paths level by level starting from the origin city.
    \item It uses a queue to manage the paths being explored.
    \item Initially, the root node (representing the origin city with zero cost and at level 0) is placed in the queue.
    \item At each iteration, the algorithm dequeues a node, and if it represents a complete tour (all cities visited), it updates the minimum cost if this tour is cheaper than previously found tours.
    \item If not all cities are visited yet, the algorithm generates all possible successor nodes by extending the current path to each unvisited city and enqueues them.
    \item The process continues until the queue is empty, ensuring that all possible tours are explored.
    \item The function returns the minimum cost of all possible tours.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{UCS Strategy Module}
\textbf{Function:} \texttt{'TSP\_UCS(dist: List[List[int]])}

\textbf{Description:} This function implements the Uniform Cost Search (UCS) algorithm to find the minimum cost route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city, minimizing the longest distance between two consecutive cities.

\textbf{Algorithm Explanation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item UCS uses a priority queue to explore paths in the order of increasing cost.
    \item The initial state starts with the origin city with zero cost and is pushed into the priority queue.
    \item The algorithm dequeues the node with the lowest cost, expanding it to generate successor nodes by visiting neighboring cities..
    \item Each successor node represents a path extending to a new city, and its cost is updated accordingly.
    \item These successor nodes are then added to the priority queue.
    \item If a node represents a complete tour, the algorithm checks if its cost is the lowest encountered so far and updates the minimum cost if it is.
    \item The algorithm continues until the priority queue is empty, ensuring that all potential tours are considered.
    \item Finally, the function returns the minimum cost of the route found.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{A* Search Module}
\textbf{Function:} \texttt{heuristic(const vector<bool>& visited, int current\_city)}

\textbf{Description:} This heuristic function estimates the minimum cost to complete the route from the current state of the node. It is used by the A* Search algorithm to prioritize nodes in the priority queue.

\textbf{Algorithm Explanation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The heuristic function calculates the minimum edge cost from the current city to any unvisited city.
    \item It combines two components:
    \item It iterates over all cities and finds the minimum distance to an unvisited city.
    \item This minimum distance is used as the heuristic estimate (h\_cost) to guide the A* Search algorithm towards the goal.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Function:} \texttt{'TSP\_AStar(dist: List[List[int]])}

\textbf{Description:} This function implements the A* Search algorithm with a heuristic function to find the minimum cost route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city, minimizing the longest distance between two consecutive cities.

\textbf{Algorithm Explanation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A* Search uses a priority queue to manage the nodes, with nodes prioritized based on their total estimated cost (f\_cost), which is the sum of the path cost (g\_cost) and a heuristic estimate (h\_cost).
    \item The initial state contains the origin city with zero cost, and its estimated cost is calculated using a heuristic function.
    \item The algorithm dequeues the node with the lowest estimated cost and generates successor nodes by visiting each unvisited neighboring city.
    \item For each successor node, the path cost is updated, and the heuristic cost is recalculated.
    \item These successor nodes are then pushed into the priority queue based on their total estimated cost.
    \item When a node represents a complete tour, the algorithm updates the minimum cost if this tour's cost is lower than previously found tours.
    \item The search continues until all nodes are explored, ensuring that the optimal route is found.
    \item The heuristic function plays a crucial role in guiding the search efficiently, potentially reducing the number of paths that need to be explored.
    \item The function returns the minimum cost of the TSP route.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiments and Evaluation}
This section requires a description of the generated data or the datasets used in the experiments. The description of the experimental setup and the results must be included here.

Initially, I created a small dataset with five cities at coordinates: \{0, 1\}, \{1, 0\}, \{2, 0\}, \{2, 1\}, and \{1, 2\}. Then, I applied each of the algorithms—TSP\_BFS, TSP\_UCS, and TSP\_AStar—to determine the minimum cost and execution time.

For larger datasets obtained from the TSP-LIB site (s70.tsp, bier127.tsp, and eli101.tsp), I modified them to reduce the number of cities to 9, 10, and 11, respectively. This adjustment was made to mitigate the high time complexity of the BFS algorithm, which grows substantially with the number of cities.

The results of all algorithms for each dataset were compiled into an Excel file. In addition, I created two charts to illustrate the exponential growth of execution time in microseconds and to demonstrate that the minimum cost remains consistent regardless of the algorithm used for a particular dataset.

\section{Conclusion}

By solving this assignment, I have improved my knowledge of how searching algorithms work and how to manage computing time to check for efficiency.
\\
I opted to use C++ as my programming language due to my familiarity with it, as I am most efficient when using it. This experience allows me to make full use of its features to find the most optimal solution for the different tasks given in the assignment.
